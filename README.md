1. Your classmate drew the following midsagittal diagram intending to represent the consonant [ŋ], shown below. You noticed, however, that this is incorrect.

a.  Describe what is wrong with your classmate’s diagram (HINT: what is represented instead, and how do you know?)
b.   Indicate the necessary ﬁxes needed to represent the consonant [ŋ] correctly. Make sure to use the relevant and appropriate terminology.
2. Give an example of implicit knowledge outside the realm of linguistics, and explain it (in one sentence).
3. Characterize the articulation of the signs below.
Example: FATHER in ASL (https://www.handspeak.com/word/758/)
- shoulder articulation: FLEXION
- elbow articulation: FLEXION  EXTENSION
- radioulnar articulation: NONE
- wrist articulation: NONE
- base knuckle articulation: ABDUCTION
- interphalangeal articulation: EXTENSIONNot every articulation counts as a part for the sign FATHER, those movements that are necessary to arrive at the base conﬁguration are not considered as part of the  sign. However, this is an exercise to actively think of manual articulators, therefore  you are asked to go through all six joints and describe their movements, regardless of w代 写LIN101 Fall, 2024 Homework 1Python

a. Characterize the articulation of one hand in the sign LIVE/ALIVE in ASL (https://www.handspeak.com/word/1290/) in terms of
- shoulder articulation:

- elbow articulation:
- radioulnar articulation:
- wrist articulation:
- base knuckle articulation:
- interphalangeal articulation:
4. Transcribing consonants
a.   List all the consonants you hear in each word. Do not use diacritics, not even  the tie-sign ͡ (only because it is not easy to type in google docs), but do use square brackets to indicate that you list sounds, and not letters. You can listen to the pronunciation of all these words at the links given. Please always listen to the American version (see below).

The symbols can be copy-pasted directly from this chart:
